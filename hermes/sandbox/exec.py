"""The agent's disposable exec sandbox — a container on the VPS, no network.

This is where agent code RUNS now: builds, tests, scripts, and the independent
verification re-run. It replaces the GPU box in that role. The GPU box goes back
to being only the model's host, reached as an inference endpoint — never a shell
the agent (or code it wrote) can reach the network from.

The container is `--network none`: the base image is pulled with the VPS's own
egress (the daemon pulls over the host, before the container exists), but once it
is running it has no interface at all, so nothing the agent executes can phone
out. That is the air-gap — enforced by the kernel, not a deny-list. The project
workspace is bind-mounted at /workspace so files the agent wrote on the VPS are
there to run, and results land back in the same workspace with no transfer step.
