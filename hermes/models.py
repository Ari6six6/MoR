"""The model catalog — the one place that knows what's different between the
models Hermes can drive.

Hermes was built around NousResearch Hermes-4.3-36B (FP8 safetensors on vLLM),
but nothing in the agent loop is actually tied to it: the wire protocol is
plain OpenAI chat-completions. So "supporting another model" reduces to a row
in this table — its weights, how vLLM should quantize/parse it, how much VRAM
it needs, and how far its context stretches. `gpu serve` lets the operator pick
a row; everything model-specific downstream (the tier planner, the vLLM launch
command, the system-prompt identity) reads it from here.

Two polarities on purpose:
  - `ready=True`  — battle-tested, the path the app was tuned on.
  - `ready=False` — wired but experimental (e.g. GGUF on vLLM is single-GPU and
    slower than native FP8); the picker flags it so the operator knows.
