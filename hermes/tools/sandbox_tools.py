"""The agent's exec sandbox tool — runs code in the air-gapped VPS container.

This is the replacement for `remote_shell` as the place code runs. The GPU box
is going back to being only the model's host; agent-run code executes here, in a
`--network none` container on the VPS, so nothing it does can reach the network.
The project workspace is bind-mounted, so files written with `write_file`
(project-relative `workspace/...`) are already present — no transfer step.
