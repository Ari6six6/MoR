"""The delegate tool: hand a focused sub-task to a clean child worker.

The child runs the same loop recursively with a minimal context and a subset of
this agent's tools, and returns one conclusion. The whole cost to this agent is
the brief plus that conclusion — the child's intermediate steps never enter this
context. See hermes/subagent.py for the mechanics and the permission/depth rules.
