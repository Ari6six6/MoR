"""The day — light to dark — and the scheduler that runs it.

`light` opens a day: the last Chant is posted first, then Wizard, General, and
Warrior wake in that order (forced by the single shared mind — they queue at the
one oracle), each runs its waking, and the General greets the Master. From then
the Master's word drives a closed loop through the Hall until he says `dark`,
when each writes its walls, the Wizard sings the day's Chant, and the loop closes.
